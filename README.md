# UntapEdoConverter
Just drop your Untap.in decklists in a .txt file into the same folder as your install.
Run the .exe and a .ydk file of the same name will be created.

Any cards that could not be converted will be displayed in the console.
Press enter to close the console after the program has finished running.

If the local database needs to update or is not present it may take a while to run.
